    "faq3_q": "How does the intelligent evaluation system work?",
    "faq3_a": "Evaluations are dynamically generated by AI based on real content from academic PDFs. They include three types of questions: true/false, multiple choice, and multiple selection with several correct answers. Each evaluation is unique and adapts to the specific topic you're studying.",
    "faq4_q": "What educational levels is the platform designed for?",
    "faq4_a": "SMART STUDENT is designed for students in the Chilean educational system, from 1st Grade to 12th Grade (Senior Year). It includes curricular content aligned with official subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, History, Language, and specialized high school subjects.",
    "faq5_q": "How are summaries and mind maps generated?",
    "faq5_a": "Summaries are created using advanced AI that analyzes academic book content and the specific topic you need to study. Mind maps visualize connections between concepts, organizing information hierarchically and structurally to facilitate understanding and memorization.",
    "faq6_q": "Does the platform save my progress and study history?",
    "faq6_a": "Yes, SMART STUDENT automatically records your progress including: completed evaluations, scores obtained, generated summaries, created mind maps, and completed quizzes. You can view detailed statistics by subject and download your academic history in Excel format.",
